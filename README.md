# 'Getting and cleaning Data' - Course project
### Introduction
Within  this repository, you can find the R file to process the raw data and generate the .txt file for the project of the course 'Getting and cleaning data', which is offered in Coursera.

The dataset used in this project can be obtained from [here].
### Files
This repository contains three files:
* **`README.md`** is the file you are reading right now.
* **`CodeBook.md`** describes variables, datasets, and transformations.
* **`run_analysis.R`** is the .R file with the R code following the required five steps. The final output of the 5th and last step is a .txt file (`average_data.txt`), and it is uploaded in the course's project form.

### How to run the analysis
1. Unzip the raw data is unzip in the same folder as the .R file.
2. Install the `plyr` package in R.
3. Run the file `run_analysis.R`.
